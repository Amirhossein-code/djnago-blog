# Note for adding additional fields for user creation
# we should not support fields outside the user model here like the fields in author model
# but if that is the case and we want to we should do so in the front end
# how? first post the details related to User model then additional fields in another post method
# for adding fields here they need to be redefiened which is not a good practice
# So we are going to pay the cost of sending 2 calls to the endpoint to have perfectly set up end points that do not interfere with each other
